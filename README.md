# rptr.js
A logic-only repeatable list component aimed at efficiency.


### Three parameters you need:
1. *Container* A DOM element to hold your soon to be rendered items.
2. *Data* An array of items you would like rendered.
3. *Renderer* A function that will know what to do when we pass it any single item from your array.


### TODO
- Clean-up the code
- Write documentation
- Build some examples with performance benchmarks
- Add method for recalculating heights on resize
